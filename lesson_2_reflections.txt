What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repository, a .git file is created in the directory, 
but no commits are made automatically.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area acts as an intermediary between commiting and making 
changes to the file(s). It offers flexibility in terms of what to 
commit and what not to.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

The contents of the staging area can be directly compared to those 
in the repository. This way we can be sure that we have only one 
logical change per commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your 
history organized? How would branches help?

Branches would be helpful in creating a separate 'branch' for testing 
your code. However your working code would still be available. Thus 
code is organized.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams help us visualize the branch structure by showing us a 
visual representation or a grpah or a map of the branches along
with the commits we have made and when.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Merging two branches together merges changes to the code and thus
we can combine experimental code with working code. We represent it 
the way we do because it is derived from both the branches of the 
code.
