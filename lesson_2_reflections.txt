What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repository, a .git file is created in the directory, 
but no commits are made automatically.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area acts as an intermediary between commiting and making 
changes to the file(s). It offers flexibility in terms of what to 
commit and what not to.
